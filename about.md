Been working almost 20 years, my passion is about software, quality and automation. This is covered nowadays under the DevOps umbrella, so I must be one.

### More Information

I'm BS in Computer Engineering, certified Professional Scrum Master, ISQTB Foundation level.

I really enforce myself to work the best I'm able to. For sure, what I really hate are _kludges_, _kludgers_ and _kludging_, so better avoid them.

My last years have been devoted to working with [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io) so I'm pretty involved in its evolution (and of course, its plugins).

In love the FOSS concept and how it enables a global improvement in plannings, developments, quality assurance (generally speaking, in every computing aspect)
